<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  <%= avatar_img_tag %>
  I&#8217;m a freelance Ruby/Rails engineer with over a decade of experience writing Ruby and Rails.
  I live in Christchurch, New&nbsp;Zealand with my wife and kids, and in recent years I've helped organise the
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Christchurch-Ruby-Group/">Christchurch Ruby</a>
   meetups and served as secretary on the
   <a href="https://ruby.nz/">Ruby New Zealand</a>
    committee.
</p>

<p>Much like Ruby, I try to be optimised for happiness â€” both my own and other people's.</p>

<p>
  I love working with good people to make useful things.
  If you're interested, get in touch! You can probably <a href="/hire">hire me</a>.
