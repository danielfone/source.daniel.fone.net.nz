* Add friction to your distractions
    - recognise that many distractions are instinctive, before you have a chance to decide
    - friction is enough to prevent many
    - HN, reddit, /etc/hosts
    - Hide sidebar, hide alerts, hide inbox

* Remove friction from your productivity
    - Automate repetitive tasks
    - Ask why do I always avoid this? How can I remove this friction?

* Allow yourself to do anything, as long as it advances your cause
    - Give freedom
    - When stuck on something I don't want to do, I'll fight with distractions all day long
    - When I have the option of doing something quite different, it'll be enough to keep me motivated
    - e.g.
      - stuck in a rut coding a particular feature
      - this is when temptation to hit HN sets in
      - Why don't you tackle one of those blog posts your were thinking about?
      - Why don't you watch that conference video you've been meaning to?
      - What else could advance my long term goals right now?
      - Why don't I go an fix the irrigation in the garden and come back to this tonight?
