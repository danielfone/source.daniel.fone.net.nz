This fact makes it very easy for us to change the views that are generated when we run `rails generate scaffold ...`. Let's say we want to change the scaffold's form template so that it uses a select box for a `belongs_to` relationship.

![select box](2014-02-01-customising-scaffold-views-in-ruby-on-rails/select-box.png)

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. **Find the original template**

    These live in the `lib/rails/generators/erb/scaffold/templates` folder of the railties gem. To find the path of the gem, we can run `bundle show railties`. Alternatively we can run `bundle open railties` and navigate to the `_form.html.erb` file. Once we've found this, we'll want to copy it.

2. **Copy it into our application**

    As quoted above, generators will search for templates in `lib/templates`. For this template, we'll need to copy it into `lib/templates/erb/scaffold/_form.html.erb` within our application's root.

3. **Change the template**

    At this point, we can make whatever changes we like!

By way of illustration, here's one way to use a select box for a belongs_to relationship.

~~~ diff
# lib/templates/erb/scaffold/_form.html.erb
@@ -23,7 +23,7 @@

+    <%%= f.collection_select :<%= attribute.column_name %>, <%= attribute.name.camelize %>.all, :id, :name, prompt: true  %>
   <%- else -%>
     <%%= f.label :<%= attribute.name %> %><br>
     <%%= f.<%= attribute.field_type %> :<%= attribute.name %> %>
~~~

I've uploaded an [example app][repo] to github, where you can see the [customised template][template] in full and also [the view][view] it generates.

Now when we run `rails generate scaffold user name:string user_type:references`, our form will use a helpful select box instead of an empty text field.
