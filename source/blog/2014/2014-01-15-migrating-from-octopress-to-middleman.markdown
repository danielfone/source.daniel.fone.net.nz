* Reason
  - friction to productivity
  - Didn't feel like I understood many parts, too many black boxes
  - Feels out of date
  - Feels over-engineered for what I need
  - As a programmer, I can do better

* Middleman
  - simple, very up to date
  - I have to do more stuff (hence understand more stuff) for myself

* Migration
  - not jekyll, hence no liquid in templates
  - URLs easy to map across
  - Wget for checking broken links
  - Rethemed with bootstrap
  - Disqus needed extra config to map discussions

* Aside
  - Still on GH pages
  - Still using disqus for comments
  - Switched to wufoo for contact form since easier to skin
