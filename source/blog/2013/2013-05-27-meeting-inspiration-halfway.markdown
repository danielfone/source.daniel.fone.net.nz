{% blockquote Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky %}
[Inspiration] does not always respond to the first invitation. We must always work, and a self-respecting artist must not fold his hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood. If we wait for the mood, without endeavouring to meet it half-way, we easily become indolent and apathetic. We must be patient, and believe that inspiration will come to those who can master their disinclination.

Sometimes as a freelancer, it can be very hard to remain productive without work from clients. when I'm busy engaged with clients, I have dozens of ideas about open source projects, business development, SaaS applications etc. But when I finally get a gap between engagements, it can be hard to turn those ideas into actionable points. I know I've hit the bottom of the motivation stack when I'm clicking through meme gifs on the frontpage of reddit.

As an engineer, I do my best work when I have a concrete problem in front of me that needs a solution in a hurry. Without that focussing effect, I find myself waiting for bursts of inspiration to fill my sails.

The antidote? *"Believe that inspiration will come to those who can master their disinclination."*

Or, to hear it another wayâ€¦
